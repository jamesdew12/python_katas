# python_katas

I will be practicing python by doing some katas from code wars, starting with easy Katas then building up to harder ones, making sure to TDD and write clean code.

Filter - filter strings in a list using another list.
Multiply - simply maths, multiply numbers together.
is it divisible - check if numbers are divisible by the 2 numbers.
